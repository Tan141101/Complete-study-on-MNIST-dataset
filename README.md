# Complete-study-on-MNIST-dataset
This is a complete research for the best model in MNIST dataset
This project is done with an aim to have better understanding of use of different models for some specific task in this case image classification of mnist dataset.
In this project we have used many different models to predict the model.
We have used different deep learning techniques such as ANN,CNN,RNN,LSTM etc
We have seen the affect of regularization of CNN with our data and also tried to look at what all classes where misclassified by using a confusion matrix
Overall this project will help anyone with the code for each of the models and also answer the question of which model is the best for classifying the mnist dataset in deep learning
